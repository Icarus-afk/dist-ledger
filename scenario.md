# TechChain Supply Network: Simplified Implementation Scenario

## Overview
TechChain is a blockchain-based supply chain network with three core components:

- **Main Chain** - Central verification layer that coordinates cross-chain communication  
- **Distributor Chain** - Records inventory, receiving from manufacturers, and shipments to retailers  
- **Retailer Chain** - Manages receiving from distributors, store inventory, and customer sales  

## Network Participants

### TechRegistry Portal  
Web interface simulating manufacturer product registration  

### Distributors on Distributor Chain:
- **DigiFlow Distribution**  
- **RegionTech Logistics**  
- **TechWholesale**  

### Retailers on Retailer Chain:
- **TechMart**  
- **ElectroShop**  
- **GadgetCorner**  

## Process Flow  

### 1. Product Registration (TechRegistry Portal)
**Implementation Focus:**
- Simple web form for entering product details  
- Products registered directly to main chain  
- Serial numbers generated and stored for each product  

**Key Data:**
- Product ID, name, specifications  
- Serial number ranges  
- Quantity manufactured  

### 2. Distributor Chain Operations
**Transaction Types:**
- `RECEIVE` - Receiving products from manufacturer  
- `INVENTORY_UPDATE` - Updating stock levels  
- `SHIPMENT_CREATE` - Creating shipments to retailers  

**Key Workflow:**
1. Distributor receives products from TechRegistry  
2. Inventory updated on distributor chain  
3. Merkle root of transactions sent to main chain  
4. Shipments created and sent to retailers  

### 3. Retailer Chain Operations
**Transaction Types:**
- `RECEIVE_FROM_DISTRIBUTOR` - Accepting shipments from distributors  
- `INVENTORY_UPDATE` - Updating store inventory  
- `SALES_RECORD` - Recording customer purchases  

**Key Workflow:**
1. Retailer receives shipments from distributor  
2. Inventory updated on retailer chain  
3. Products sold to customers with serial number tracking  
4. Sales summarized and sent to main chain  

### 4. Cross-Chain Verification
- Main chain stores Merkle roots from both distributor and retailer chains  
- Merkle proofs used to verify transactions across chains  
- Main chain coordinates data integrity between chains  

## Block Structure

### Transaction Schema
Each transaction across all chains follows this basic structure:

```plaintext
| Attribute         | Type    | Description                          |
|------------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| Transaction ID   | String | Unique identifier                 |
| Transaction Type | Enum   | Type-specific to each chain       |
| Related Entity   | String | ID of related party               |
| Product ID       | String | Product identifier                |
| Quantity         | Integer| Number of items                   |
| Status          | String  | Current status                   |
| Additional Data | JSON   | Chain-specific data fields        |
```
## Example Workflow: Smartphone Distribution
### Product Registration:

- TechRegistry registers 5,000 "X12 Pro" smartphones on main chain

#### Distributor Operations:

- DigiFlow receives 3,000 units on distributor chain
- Inventory updated with serial numbers
- DigiFlow creates shipment of 1,000 units to TechMart
- Shipment recorded on distributor chain

#### Retailer Operations:

- TechMart receives 1,000 units on retailer chain
- Inventory updated with verified serial numbers
- TechMart sells units to customers, recording each sale
- Sales data summarized daily on retailer chain

#### Cross-Chain Verification:

- Main chain maintains verification of product location
- TechMart can verify product authenticity through main chain
- Complete product history viewable across all chains

## Implementation Focus
### Three Chain Architecture:

- Main chain for coordination and verification
- Distributor chain with streams for each distributor
- Retailer chain with streams for each retailer

### Cross-Chain Communication:

- Merkle proof verification between chains
- Two-Phase Commit for critical transactions
- Main chain as the verification authority

### Serial Number Tracking:

- Products traceable from manufacturer to consumer
- Serial numbers verified at each transfer point
- Complete history accessible through blockchain
